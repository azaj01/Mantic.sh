**Semantic Reranking, Code Intelligence, and Performance Improvements**

This release introduces local neural reranking, deep code intelligence via Tree-sitter, and significant performance optimizations (~2x faster).

### 1. Semantic Reranking (Hybrid Intelligence)
- **Neural Engine**: Added `--semantic` flag which downloads and runs `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` locally via `transformers.js`.
- **Hybrid Scoring**: Combines structural score (paths/filenames) with cosine similarity of vector embeddings.
- **Zero Egress**: All vectorization and reranking happens on your local machine. No data sent to cloud.

### 2. Code Intelligence (Deep Context)
- **Engine**: Integrated `web-tree-sitter` for robust AST parsing.
- **Go to Definition**: `mantic goto <symbol>` finds the definition of any class, function, or type across the repo.
- **Find References**: `mantic references <symbol>` finds all usages.
- **Cross-Language**: Full support for TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python.

### 3. Team Memories (Learning)
- **Persistence**: "Learned patterns" (which queries map to which files) are now persisted to `.mantic/search-patterns.json`.
- **Sync**: Teams can commit this file to git to share "organization knowledge" instantly.

### Stability & Security Fixes
- **ReDoS Protection**: Added length guards to regex searches to prevent Denial of Service attacks.
- **Type Safety**: Fixed `ZeroQueryContext` type mismatches.
- **Command Injection**: Patched a vulnerability in the VS Code extension where search queries could execute shell commands.
- **Non-Git Fallback**: CLI now gracefully handles non-git directories using `fast-glob`.
- **Python Support**: Fixed dependency graph parsing for Python `import` statements.

### Technical Details
- **MCP Server**: Added `get_definition`, `find_references`, and `semantic` search support.
- Added dependencies: `@xenova/transformers`, `web-tree-sitter`, `fast-glob`.
- Updated `vscode-extension` to use `shell: false`.

## 1.0.21

**Major Release: Production-Ready Context-Aware Code Search**

This release transforms Mantic from a fast file finder into an intelligent context-aware search engine. Tested on codebases ranging from 10K to 481K files (Chromium, TensorFlow, Next.js, Supabase, Cal.com) with 100% multi-repo accuracy.

**Key Highlights:**
- Search accuracy improvements with CamelCase detection and exact filename matching
- Zero-query mode for proactive context detection
- Progressive disclosure with file metadata (size, tokens, confidence)
- Context carryover between searches via session management
- Learning system that caches successful search patterns
- Full MCP feature parity with CLI

### Major Search Accuracy Improvements

**Core Enhancements:**
- **CamelCase Detection**: Queries like "ScriptController" now correctly match `script_controller.h` files by detecting and normalizing CamelCase before searching
- **Exact Filename Matching**: Perfect filename matches (e.g., "download_manager.cc") receive massive priority boost (10,000 points) to ensure they appear first
- **Directory Boosting for Acronyms**: Single-term queries like "gpu" now prioritize files in matching directories (e.g., `gpu/BUILD.gn`, `android_webview/gpu/`) over random files containing "gpu"
- **Word-Boundary Matching**: Prevents false positives - "script" no longer matches "javascript", only matches at word boundaries
- **Path Sequence Matching**: Multi-term path queries (e.g., "blink renderer core dom") now filter precisely to matching directory structures

**Technical Improvements:**
- Fixed normalization order: normalize BEFORE lowercase to preserve CamelCase detection
- Added `pathParts` to FileEntry for efficient path component matching
- Extension filtering now uses original query format to preserve exact matches
- Structural specificity scoring with word-boundary awareness prevents substring false positives
- Single-term query detection enables smart directory-based boosting for acronyms

**Search Quality Results (tested on Chromium's 481K files):**
- Exact filename queries return perfect matches
- CamelCase queries work seamlessly without manual conversion
- Component path queries filter precisely to target directories
- Acronym searches prioritize relevant directories
- Extension precision (.h vs .cc) works flawlessly
- 7/8 perfect accuracy on complex edge cases

### Zero-Query Mode
- **Proactive Context Detection**: Run `mantic` with no arguments to see current working context
- **Git-Aware Tracking**: Automatically detects modified files and related dependencies
- **Impact Analysis**: Shows blast radius and risk assessment for changes
- **Smart Suggestions**: Recommends next steps based on current work
- **Auto Session Management**: Creates sessions automatically based on file activity
- **Multi-Format Output**: JSON (default), terminal (--markdown), or files-only (--files)

### Progressive Disclosure
- **File Metadata**: Shows size, line count, estimated tokens for each result
- **Temporal Signals**: Includes last modified and creation timestamps
- **Confidence Scores**: Relative confidence (0-1) based on search score distribution
- **Smart Context**: Helps LLMs make informed decisions about which files to read

### Context Carryover
- **Session Memory**: Previously viewed files receive +150 score boost in subsequent searches
- **Seamless Continuity**: Related queries automatically prioritize session context
- **Session Management**: Automatic tracking via SessionManager integration

### Learning System
- **Pattern Recognition**: Successful searches (score > 50) are cached for future queries
- **Persistent Learning**: Patterns saved to `.mantic-cache/search-patterns.json`
- **Adaptive Boosting**: Previously successful paths get priority in similar queries

### MCP Server Updates
- **Context Carryover Support**: `search_files` now accepts `sessionId` parameter to enable context carryover
- **Zero-Query Tool**: New `get_context` tool for proactive context detection via MCP
- **Full Feature Parity**: MCP server now supports all CLI features including progressive disclosure, context carryover, and zero-query mode
- **Session Integration**: Seamless session management through MCP tools

### Testing & Validation
- **Multi-Repo Test Suite**: 14/14 tests passing across diverse codebases
  - Cal.com (TypeScript/Next.js, 10K files)
  - Next.js (Framework, 20K+ files)
  - Supabase (Backend Platform, 15K+ files)
  - TensorFlow (ML/Python/C++, 50K+ files)
  - Chromium (C++/Browser, 481K files)
- **Systematic Iteration**: Test-fix-validate cycle ensuring production quality
- **Edge Case Coverage**: CamelCase, exact filenames, path sequences, acronyms, extensions

### Performance
- Sub-second search on repos up to 50K files (standard engine)
- Parallel engine for 50K+ files with automatic threshold switching
- Progressive disclosure adds minimal overhead (<5ms per file)
- Learning system cache lookups near-instant
- Quality filtering: Automatic removal of low-confidence results (score < 50) to reduce false positives

**Performance Characteristics** (tested on 5 real-world repos):
- Cal.com (9.7K files): ~0.4-0.7s per query
- Next.js (20K files): ~0.9-1.0s per query
- TensorFlow (50K files): ~0.8-1.1s per query
- Chromium (481K files): ~3.5-4.0s per query

**Speed Rankings** (cal.com, "stripe payment" query):
1. ripgrep: 0.121s (fastest)
2. ag: 0.269s
3. fzf: 0.534s
4. Mantic: 0.654s
5. grep: 1.970s

**Large Repo Performance** (Chromium, 481K files, "ScriptController" query):
- fzf: 0.336s (fastest)
- ripgrep: 0.380s
- Mantic: 3.676s
- ag: 46.562s (12.7x slower than Mantic)

**Trade-off**: 2-10x slower than ripgrep/fzf on small repos, but 12.7x faster than ag on large repos, with superior relevance ranking

### When to Use Mantic vs Other Tools

**Use Mantic for:**
- AI agent code searches (primary use case)
- Finding files by intent ("Where is the payment processing code?")
- Path structure queries ("blink renderer core dom")
- CamelCase searches without manual regex ("ScriptController" → script_controller.h)
- Understanding code impact and relationships
- Context-aware searches with session memory
- High-quality results over speed (10 relevant files vs 200+ false positives)

**Use ripgrep for:**
- Quick text searches ("Find all TODOs")
- Exact string matching
- Content-based searches (searching inside files)
- Maximum speed on large codebases

**Use fzf for:**
- Interactive file browsing with fuzzy matching
- Quick filename lookups when you know part of the name
- Maximum speed (10x faster than Mantic on large repos)
- Note: Returns many false positives on multi-word queries

**Use ag (Silver Searcher) for:**
- Medium-sized repos (10-50K files)
- Text-based searches similar to ripgrep
- Note: 12.7x slower than Mantic on large repos (481K files)

**Verdict**: Mantic prioritizes quality over speed. Trade-offs:
- 2-10x slower than ripgrep/fzf on small repos
- 12.7x faster than ag on large repos (481K files)
- 10 relevant files vs fzf's 200+ false positives
- Superior relevance ranking over all text-based tools

### Breaking Changes
None. This is a backward-compatible enhancement release.
